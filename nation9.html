        <div class="myDiv"><p>Biafra secessionist western African state that unilaterally declared its independence<br>
            from <strong>Nigeria</strong> in may 1967. it <u draggable="true">constituted</u> the former Eastern Region of Nigeria and was<br>
            inhabited principally by <em>Igbos</em>(ibo) people. Biafra ceased to exist as an Independent<br>
            state in January 1970.

        <p>
            In the mid-1960<sub>s</sub> economic and political insatbility and ethnic friction characterized<br>
            Nigerian public life. In the mostly Hausa north, resentment against the more prosperous<br>
            educated igbo minorty erupted into violence. in September 1966, some 10,000 to 30,000 <br>
            igbo people were massacred in the Northern Region, and perhaps 1,000,000 fled as refugees<br>
            to the igbo-dominated east. Non-Igbos were then expelled from the Eastern Region.

            Attempts by representatives of all regions to come to an agreement were Unsuccessful. <br>
            on <time datetime="1967-05-30">30 May, 1967</time> the head of the Eastern Region, Lieuteant Colonel (later General) Odumegwu Ojukwu
            with the authorization of a cosultative assembly, declared the region a sovereign and<br>
            Independent republic under the name of Biafra. General Yakubu Gowon, the leader of the fedral<br>
            government, refeused to recognize Biafra sececcion. in the hostilities that broke out the <br>
            following july, Biafran troops were at first sucessful, but soon the numerically superior <br>
            federal forces began to press Biafra's boundaries inward from the south, west, and north. <br>
            Biafra shrank to one-tenth its original area in the course of the war. By 1968 it had lost <br>
            it's seaports and become landlocked; supplies could be brought in only by air. starvation <br>
            and disease followed; estimates of mortality during the war generally range from 500,000 to 3,000,000.

        <p>
            The Organization of African Unity, the papacy, and others tried to reconcile the combantants.<br>
            Most countries continued to recognize Gowon's regime as the government of all Nigeria, an the <br>
            the United kingdom and the Soviet Union supplied it with arms. on the other hand, international<br>
            Sympathy for the plight of starving Biafran children brought airlifts of food and medicine from <br>
            many countries. Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Tanzania, and Zambia recognized Biafra as an independent <br>
            state, and france sent biafra weapons.

            Biafran forces were finally routed in a series of engagements in late December 1969 and early <br>
            January 15,1970. Biafra, on the point of total collapse, thereupon ceased to exist.
