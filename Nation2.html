        <p> Martin cooper born <time datetime="1928-12-26"> 26 december 1928 </time> <address>Chicago Illinois united States of America.</address>
            American enginner who led the team that in 1972-73 built the <em>Mobile Cell phone</em><br>
            and the <i>first Cellphone call.</i> He is widely regarded as the <pre><b>Father of the Cellphones</b></pre>

        <p> Phone in full <mark>Cellular Telephone</mark>, Wireless telephone that permits telecommunication with<br>
            a defined area that may include hundreds of square miles, using <small>radio waves in the 800-900</small><sub>mhz</sub><br>
            band. To implement a Cellphone system, a geographic <sup>area</sup> is broken into smaller areas or cells<br>
            usually mapped as uniform hexagrams but in fact overlapping and <s>regularly</s> irregularly shaped. Each cell is<br>
            equipped with a <del> high </del> slow powered radio transmitter and reciever that permits propagation of signals<br>
            between Cellphones users.

        <p> <dfn>Smartphones</dfn> Devices with a dispaly screen typically a <abbr title="Liquiid Crystal Display">LCD</abbr> built in personal information<br>
            management programmes (such as an electric calender and address book) typically found in a personal digital<br>
            assistant (PDA), and an <ins> Operating System (OS) </ins> that allows other computer software to be installed for web<br>
            browsing, email, music, video, and other applications. A smartohone maybe thought of as a handheld computer<br>
            integrated within a mobile telephone.
